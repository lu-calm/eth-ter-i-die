-= This information was updated and correct as of: 15/08/2020 =-

-= Note: This section creates a method of transferring Ether and Assets to Fiat
Currencies to a local currency. This is essentially your own Wallet and should be 
treated like a bank account, keeping access information as safe as possible =-

Coinbase is a digital asset exchange that brokers the transfer of Cryptocurrencies to
Fiat Currencies and vice versa.

Coinbase can be referred as an "Off Ramp" as you can use Coinbase to transfer the value
of Ether off the Ethereum Blockchain and into Fiat Currency. We will be using it for
this purpose.

Within this section of the document we will cover the following topics.

-= Account Set-up Process =-
-= Your Wallets =-
-= Transfer from Ether to Local Currency =-

These may be referenced in other sections from other services in this document.
These topics may not be conducted in order and may need to be conducted multiple times
throughout this document.

-= Account Set-up Process =-

In order to transfer the value of my Ethereum based Assets to money you can send to your
bank account, you will need to create an account with Coinbase.

In your internet browser search/ address bar type: "coinbase.com"

Press Enter to access the website

From here you will need to go through the process of creating an account.

If you have issues with the account creation process, in your internet browser
search/ address bar type "help.coinbase.com". Once the site is accessed, use the search
feature to help resolve your issue. Remember do not share any information in this 
documentation your support request.

Click the "Get Started" button and fill in your details including name, address, 
password and click the checkbox to agree to Coinbase's terms and conditions once happy 
to continue.

You will be sent a verification email to the email address you supplied. Follow the link
supplied in the email from Coinbase.

As an additional security requirement Coinbase will direct you to set up two-step
verification. Two-step verification requires a valid cell/ mobile phone number. Once you
have submitted your phone number, a code will be sent to your cell/ mobile phone to type
into Coinbase. Each time you log-in to Coinbase account you will need you phone as the
log-in process requires a code that will be sent to your phone. In addition to log-ins,
the two step verification will be used when you transfer funds from your account.

You will then be directed to submit your Personal Identifying Information, for example
where you live.

In order to transfer Ethereum to your local currency then to your own bank account a few
more steps are required. The verification process for these steps may take a few days.

First a payment method needs to be given, this is your bank account where my Ether and
Assets, once converted to local currency, will be sent.

Click the silhouette profile icon on the top right of the webpage and click on the
Settings link.

This will give you all the details about your account. Navigate to "Payment methods" and
click the "Add a payment method" option. Choose the correct Bank Account option for
yourself and follow the onscreen instructions to complete the Bank account set-up.

For the transferring, converting and depositing of Cryptocurrencies to Fiat currencies
additional verification is required.

In the Settings area, visited previously, navigate to "Account limits." You will be asked
to provide photo ID (uploading a colour image of passport or driving license) and provide
a "selfie" photo. Follow the instructions on screen and await verification confirmation,
this could take a few days.

You will also need to add additional verification by supplying Coinbase with proof of the
Personal Identifying Information you had previously submitted. Follow the instructions on
screen and await confirmation, this could take a few days.

Once all the verification is confirmed you should have all the access required in order
to continue with the next section.

-= Your Wallets =-

My Ether, in my Address needs to be sent from my Address to your Ethereum Address in
Coinbase for you to then convert it to your local currency. The conversion from Ether to
local currency will take place in Coinbase. Future sections of this document will guide
you on how to send Ether and convert Assets to Ether.

in this section we will identify:
- Your Coinbase Ethereum Address which my Ether will be sent to
- Your local currency wallet on Coinbase that will convert the Ether to local currency
- How to deposit that money into your bank account.

-=Your Ethereum Address=-

Your Ethereum Address provided by Coinbase can be found by clicking the "Portfolio" link
on the top left of the Coinbase webpage.

Scroll down the page and it will display a section called "Your assets". There will be a
lot of options available, however we are only interested in the "Ethereum" option.

Click "Ethereum".

This will lead you to a page with Ethereum Eth as a headline. If this is not correct you
may have selected another cryptocurrency, click the "Portfolio" link again and navigate
and find "Ethereum" in the "Your assets" list. On this page it will display your current
Ether balance, this will be 0 for now. On the right hand of the page there is an option
that says "Receive".

Click the "Receive" text.

Underneath the Square QR Code on the right-hand side of the page
(you may need to scroll down) there will be text labelled "Address". The code to the
right of the Address text is Your Ethereum Address.

You may not be able to view the whole address on your screen however if you press the
icon (of two squares) next to the Ethereum Address your full Ethereum Address will be
copied for you to paste wherever needed.

This address is where we will be sending my Ether in the future.

Do not write the Address down to use as there may be a possibility of mistyping the
Address out.

When you need to enter in your Ethereum Address to receive Ether, I recommend navigating 
to this page and copying the Address code by pressing the icon as described above. 
Then paste your Address in the appropriate field.

-=Transfer from Ether to Local Currency=-

Note: This section of the document should only be done once all previous sections of the
whole document have been completed.

Note: The wording "Local Currency" represents the currency you to bank with, substitute
this wording with the name of the currency you use.

Coinbase allows you to convert Ether to your "Local currency". You will only be able to
do this when you have Ether in your Ethereum Address, therefore this should only be done
once all the Ether transfers have been done from my Address to Your Address. You may 
need to come back to this section of the document at a later point once all the 
Transactions have been completed from My Address.

To transfer the Ether, start by clicking the portfolio link on the top left of the
Coinbase webpage.

Scroll down the page and it will display a section called "Your assets". There will be a
lot of options available, however we are only interested in the "Ethereum" option.

Click "Ethereum".

This will lead you to a page with Ethereum Eth as a headline. If this is not correct you
may have selected another cryptocurrency, click the "Portfolio" link again and navigate
and find "Ethereum" in the "Your assets" list.

Click the "Trade" button on the top right of the page.

This will open a pop-up.

Click the "Sell" text.

Click "Sell All".

Click "Sell Ethereum".

Accept the trade confirmation.

This will convert the Ether into your local currency and deposit it in your local
currency wallet in Coinbase.

Please note: Coinbase will charge a fee for this process.

Now we need to withdraw this local currency from your Coinbase local currency wallet to
your bank account.

Start by clicking the portfolio link on the top left of the Coinbase webpage.

Scroll down the page and it will display a section called "Your assets". There will be a
lot of options available, however we are only interested in the "Local currency" option.

Click your "Local currency" in the "Your assets" section of the webpage.

After the successful trade of Ether to your "Local currency" the "Balance" should be
updated to the value you sold the Ether to minus the Coinbase's fees.

Click on the "Withdraw" text on the right of the screen.

Select the bank account you want to withdraw to and enter the amount to withdraw.

Click "Confirm" to agree to the withdrawal.

Please note Coinbase will charge a fee for this process.

It may take a few days for the funds to be received into your bank account.

If you have issues with the Ether withdrawal process, in your internet browser
search/ address bar type "help.coinbase.com". Once the site is accessed, use the search
feature to help resolve your issue. Remember do not share any information in this
document in your support request.

End of Coinbase section.
