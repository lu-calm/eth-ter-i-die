address using EthVM.

In your browsers search/ address bar type:

https://www.ethvm.com/address/"My Ethereum Address"

Put My Ethereum Address, that I have identified previously, into the website URL.

Do not include the quotation marks or any spaces.

Once completed, press Enter on the keyboard to access the website.

EthVM should load up with My Ethereum Address details.

Take note of the "Address section"

The "ETH Balance" refers to how much Ether is in my Address.

The "USD Value" refers to how much that Ether is worth in US Dollars.

The "Total ERC20" refers to how many different Asset types I have in my Address.

Next we will looking the section below the "Address" section. By Default
"Transaction History" is highlighted.

Click "ERC20 Tokens"

Once loaded this will display a list of Assets I have associated with this Account as
well as the current worth in US Dollars on how much Ethereum based Assets are
associated with my Address.

Note: Not all "ERC20 Tokens" displayed will be removed from my address during

(like SPAM emails, interacting with them may cause losses.)

The aim of this document is to retrieve as much of the financial worth displayed in
the "Address" section to your bank account.
