it to interact with Decentralised Applications (DApps).

-= Access My Ethereum Wallet =-

You will be using MetaMask to access My Wallet and use My Ethereum Address to interact
with DApps and send Ether to your Off-Ramp.

First, we need to import My Wallet.

We do this by using my Seed Phrase. A Seed Phrase is a collection of 12 words that give
you the authorisation to access a Wallet and its contents. It is vital that you keep this
Seed Phrase safe and secure.

DO NOT share my Seed Phrase with anyone.

The Seed Phrase will need to be typed correctly and in the correct order for it to work.
Each line is a new word, 12 words in total.

My Seed Phase:

_____________

_____________

_____________

_____________

_____________

_____________

_____________

_____________

_____________

_____________

_____________

_____________


You will use this Seed Phrase to access My Wallet and its contents.

Click on the MetaMask icon (the fox) on the top right of your web browser.

This will open a new page, welcoming you to MetaMask.

Press the “Get Started” button.

This will bring you to a page asking if you are new to MetaMask.

While you may be new to MetaMask, my Wallet is not new and you have access to my 12 word
Seed Phrase.

Therefore, click “Import Wallet”.

Press “I agree” on the following page.

The new page title should be “Import an account with seed phrase”.

Click the “show seed phrase” option, this will allow you to see the words you type to
make it easier to check.

Carefully enter “My Seed Phrase” as identified previously, into the box labelled
“Seed phrase”. Once a word has been written press “Enter” on your keyboard to add in the
next word. This allows for each word to be entered on a new line in the text form.
Be careful not to add any spaces.

Once complete check the Seed Phrase carefully with what I have written.

Create a password. This is a new password to be used by you. You may be asked for this
password as you use MetaMask. Make sure you keep this new password safe and secure but
make sure you can remember it.

Note: If you do forget the password you can go through this -=Access My Ethereum Wallet=-
section again from the part where you import the wallet.

Click the “I have read and agree to the Terms of Use” when you are satisfied.

Click “Import”.

You now have access to the contents of my Address and Wallet.

-= Interact with DApps =-

This section provides rough details on how to interact with DApps using MetaMask.
Specific guidance will be provided on the particular DApps as you go through the guide.

With MetaMask you are the able to interact with DApps through your web browser.

In order to interact with it you will be required to “Connect” the MetaMask Wallet.

While the exact method of connection may differ from DApp to DApp the process should
be similar.

On the DApp there will be a “Connect Wallet” button or similar.

Click on this.

MetaMask will display on a portion of your webpage.

Accept the connection.

The MetaMask Wallet is now able to interact with the DApp.

-= Send Ether to Off-Ramp =-

Note: This section of the document should only be done once all previous sections of
the whole document have been completed (apart from the -=Transfer from Ether to
Local Currency=-  section in your Off-ramp.)

After you have successfully completed the rest of the document it is now time to sent
my Ether to your Off-Ramp.

For this to take place you need to have access to Your Ethereum Wallet Address. Open
up your Off-Ramp account and go to the location where you are able to copy Your Ethereum
Wallet Address.

Open MetaMask by clicking on the MetaMask icon (the fox) on the top right of your
web browser.

This will open MetaMask into a portion of your browser screen.

Click on the menu icon on the top-left corner.

Click on the “Ethereum”, Identified with the Ethereum Logo and with the amount of ETH
in the Wallet.

Click on “Send”.

In the “To” field right click and paste your Off-Ramp Ethereum Wallet Address.

As this will be the last transaction this Wallet will be doing, in the “Amount”
field click “Max”.

The Transaction Fee will be automatically calculated and deducted from the amount to
be sent. There is no need to change anything in that field.

Click “Next”.

There will be a summary screen that will confirm the request.

Click “Send”.

The Transaction will now take place, this may take minutes, hours, or even days depending
on how busy the Ethereum network is and the Network Fee that was paid.

There will be a transaction confirmation notice on MetaMask once the transaction has
been successful.

If the Transaction was unsuccessful, repeat this section.

Once successful all my Ether will now be in your Off-Ramp Ethereum Wallet.
