Appendix â€“ Glossary

Address: Ether and Assets are stored to an Address. Addresses consist of 42
lower case letters, upper case letters and numbers. An Ethereum address is like a
physical address or an email. To send Ether and Assets the sender needs the Address
of the recipient.

Address Owner: The individual or group of individuals that can send Ether and Assets from
that specific address. Essentially anyone who has access to the Seed Phrase of an Address
could be counted as the Address Owner even if they were not authorised to it.
Therefore, please keep my Seed Phrase safe.

Assets: In this document Assets are Ethereum based Assets. Ethereum based Assets are
digital items, coins and tokens that are created, traded or otherwise utilised on the
Ethereum Blockchain. Assets can have a variety of uses and monetary value.

Blockchain: At its core Blockchain technology is secure record keeping of Assets of all 
the accounts using the Blockchain. At a simple level a Blockchain is a long line of 
blocks that contain the results of transactions on them. When a new block is created and 
added to the line, the contents of the block will contain the result of the latest 
transactions that have occurred. For example, Mary sends 1 Ether to Sarah, that movement 
is called a Transaction. Once the Transaction fee is paid and the Transaction is approved 
the result will be recorded on the next block that will be created and Sarah will 
have +1 Ether. Once a block is created and accepted to be a part of the Blockchain it is 
very difficult to change the contents of the transactions that took place.


Cryptocurrency: Used to describe currencies that use Blockchain technology.
Blockchain technology is underpinned by cryptography, which is advanced mathematics that
provide high levels of security. Hence the "crypto" part of the word. Ether is the main
Cryptocurrency on the Ethereum Blockchain however the Ethereum Blockchain allows for
individuals and companies to create, trade and utilise their own cryptocurrencies on
the Ethereum Blockchain.

Decentralised Applications (DApps): Like applications on your mobile/ cell phone, however
DApps are hosted on many different servers in many different locations and not a single
location. DApps can have any uses from games and social media to finance.

Decentralised: The Ethereum Blockchain is understood to be decentralised as the
Blockchain runs on thousands of computers/ servers worldwide.

Ether: The primary Cryptocurrency/ Token of the Ethereum Blockchain. Ether can be traded
and used to pay for Transaction fees.

Ethereum: A decentralised Blockchain that has its own currency (Ether) and the capability
to create other Cryptocurrencies and Tokens.

Fiat Currencies: An established, government regulated/ controlled form of currency.
For example, the United States of America Dollar. Fiat comes from the Latin word fiat
meaning "let it be done" used as a resolution. Fiat currencies serve as a medium of
exchange. The government that controls the Fiat currency, controls the supply of
that currency.

Fungible Tokens: These can be created, traded and utilised by individuals or companies.
Fungible tokens are interchangeable, uniform and divisible tokens. An example of a
real-world fungible token is the United States of America Dollar.

Gas: Required in order to complete a transaction. The more complex the transaction is,
the more Gas that is required. Gas is paid in Ether, it is normally represented in a 
smaller unit of Ether known as Gwei. 1,000,000,000 Gwei is equal to 1 Ether, like how 
100 Cents are in 1 Dollar. An Address will need Ethereum/ Gwei associated with it in 
order to carry out a Transaction. The price of Gas changes dependant on the amount of 
Transactions being requested to be made on the Ethreum Blockchain. 

Gas Price: The amount of Ether (normally represented in Gwei) that Gas will cost.

Gwei: 1,000,000,000 Gwei is equal to 1 Ether, like how 100 Cents are in 1 Dollar.

Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs): These can be created, traded and utilised by individuals or
companies. Fungible tokens are unique and non-divisible tokens. An example of a real-world
non-fungible token is a piece of artwork like the Mona Lisa.

Off Ramp: A term used to describe a service that can transfer your Ethereum Blockchain
Assets to Fiat currency.

Public Blockchain: A Blockchain where the public can observe the address and transactions
taking place on it. Ethereum is a Public Blockchain.

Real World Value: A term used in this document to reiterate that Ether and Ethereum based
assets can be transferred to Fiat currencies.

Seed Phrase: A collection of 12 or more words that will give access to the Ether and
Assets of an Ethereum Address. Essentially anyone who has access to the Seed Phrase of
an Address could be counted as the Address Owner even if they were not authorised to it.
Therefore, please keep my Seed Phrase safe.

Tokens: On the Ethereum Blockchain are essentially Cryptocurrencies on the Ethereum
Blockchain and can be traded to Ethereum Addresses and utilised within DApps. There are
two types of tokens Fungible, and Non-fungible tokens, additional information on these
two types are identified in this glossary. In this document Tokens that are not Ether are
known as Assets. See Assets in this glossary for further information.

Transaction: An exchange of information, Ether, Assets on the Ethereum Blockchain. It
requires a transaction fee known as Gas which is paid in Ether. A new transaction is
recorded as part of a new block in the Blockchain. When the block is verified the
transaction will be represented in the Blockchain. For example, Mary sends 1 Ether to
Sarah, that movement is called a Transaction. Once the Transaction fee is paid and the
Transaction is approved the result will be recorded on the next block that will be
created and Sarah will have +1 Ether.

Wallet: An Ethereum Wallet allows for the transfer of Ether and Assets from the associated
Ethereum address to other Ethereum addresses. Access to an Ethereum Wallet should be kept
as secures as possible.
