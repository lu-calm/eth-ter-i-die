Date ___/____/_____


Dear _______________,




This document will explain how you will be able to access my Cryptocurrency Assets 
based on the Ethereum Blockchain.

There may be a lot of new words and concepts that will be introduced to you. Words
with high importance of understanding have been capitalised throughout this document.
These words can be referenced in the glossary found in the appendix to assist with 
your understanding with more detailed explanations.

Cryptocurrencey is a term used to describe currencies that use Blockchain technology.
Blockchain technology is secure record keeping of Assets of all the accounts 
using the Blockchain.

Ethereum is a decentralised Blockchain that has its own currency (Ether) and can
create other Cryptocurrencies and Tokens. Ether, Cryptocurrencies and Tokens have 
real world monetary value. These instructions will guide you in how to move
my Ether, Cryptocurrencies and Tokens (Assets) off the Ethereum Blockchain to money in
your bank account.

Ether, Crytocurrencies and Tokens will be referenced as "Assets" for the remainder
of this document.

Ether and Ethereum based Assets are stored to an Address. Addresses consist
of 42 lower case letters, upper case letters and numbers. As Ethereum is a public
Blockchain anybody can see how much Ether and Assets the Address is holding. The Ether
and Assets will stay in the Address until the Address owner authorises a Transaction to
another Address. Authorisation is given through a Wallet that is associated with that
Address. A Wallet is like a bank account, Wallet passwords and Seed Phrases should be
kept private. The holders of the Wallets passwords/ Seed Phrases essentially own the
Address and thus the Ether and Assets in that address. Wallets take different forms, from
software on a computer, application on a phone, plugin on an internet browser, hardware
and even contents on paper.

The Ethereum Blockchain allows for applications to store and interact with data on it.
As the Ethereum Blockchain is Decentralised these applications they are often referred to
as Decentralised Applications (DApps.) Like applications on a mobile phone, Dapps can
provide a variety of functions. Some Dapps are games that create new Assets as they are
played, some DApps transfer Assets from one type to another, some DApps offer lending
and borrowing of Ether or Assets. Beyond these basic examples there are many different 
types of DApps that have many different functionalities. DApps can store Ether and Assets 
from an Address but will require the authorisation of the associated Wallet. To remove 
the Ether and Assets stored in the DApp back to the Address also requires the 
authorisation of the associated Wallet.

The movement of Ether or Assets from one address to another is called a Transaction.
On the Ethereum Blockchain, Transactions require payments for them to be carried out.
The price of the Transaction is dependent on how much Gas the transaction requires and 
the current Gas Price. The amount of Gas the Transaction requires depends on the 
complexity of the Transaction. The Gas Price changes depending on how many 
Transactions the Ethereum network is currently requested to make. Transaction times 
can take seconds, several minutes or even days. Generally, the higher the
Gas Price you pay, the quicker the Transaction will take place. When you set up a
Transaction through a Wallet you can choose what Gas Price you are willing to pay 
for the Transaction. Wallets also offer default Gas Price options with indications
of how long the Transaction will take at that point in time. Gas is paid in Ether, 
it is normally represented in a smaller unit of Ether known as Gwei.
1,000,000,000 Gwei is equal to 1 Ether, like how 100 Cents are in 1 Dollar. An Address
will need Ethereum/ Gwei associated with it in order to carry out a Transaction.

To summarise, my Ether and Assets are stored in Wallets and DApps on the Ethereum
Blockchain. Ether and Assets have real world monetary value. In order to transfer 
the Ether and Assets Transactions will need to be made and the Gas Price paid. 
The instructions within this document will guide you on how to retrieve my Ether 
and Assets and convert them to money that can be deposited into your bank account.
