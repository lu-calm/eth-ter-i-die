These may be referenced in other sections from other services in this document.
These topics may not be conducted in order and may need to be conducted multiple times
throughout this document.

-= My Ethereum Address =-

My Ethereum Address is made of numbers, lower case letters and upper case letters, 
there will be no spaces or special characters within it. My Ethereum Address is 
publicly known information and, like a postal address, is required in order 
to receive Assets.

My Ethereum Address:

___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___

___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___ ___

-= Using the Blockchain Explorer =-

We will now use My Ethereum Address to view the Ether and Ethereum based assets in my
address using Etherscan.io.

In your browsers search/ address bar type:

https://etherscan.io/address/"My Ethereum Address"

Put My Ethereum Address, that I have identified previously, into the website URL.

Do not include the quotation marks or any spaces.

Once completed, press Enter on the keyboard to access the website.

Etherscan.io should load up with My Ethereum Address details.

Take note of the "Overview" section.

The "Balance" refers to how much Ether is in my Address.

The "Ether Value" refers to how much that Ether is worth in US Dollars.

The "Token" field refers to the current worth in US Dollars on how much Ethereum based
Cryptocurrencies and Tokens (Assets) are associated with my Address.

Note: Not all "Tokens" displayed will be removed from my address during the instructions
on this document as some are considered SPAM Tokens
(like SPAM emails, interacting with them may cause losses.)

The aim of this document is to retrieve as much of the financial worth displayed in
the "Overview" section to your bank account.

End of Etherscan.io section.
